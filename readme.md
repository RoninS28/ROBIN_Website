# ROBIN_Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a industry 4.0 end-to-end website for customers as well as for the EV industry related entities such as service centres, factory workers, etc. 
Here, customers can book their vehicles without having to go through the hassle of visiting nearby showrooms. They can view the products online and would be able to book their EVs online itself. They can avail services such as booking test drives, live tracking the manufacturing of their EVs, booking servicing appointments, breakdown services, getting quick fixes from website's chatbot, and much more. It provides the customers full transparency of the insides of the industry. Having trouble with your EV? No need to call technicians! Just type your problem in the chatbot and get ai based smart responses!
Not only customers, but also the servicemen and factory workers are benefited from this, since they can directly place orders for materials they require. Breakdown repairmen can also skip the part of continuously asking the customer for directions to their location, and get their live location, as well as be well prepared with tools beforehand with the recommendation received from the chatbot.
